# workout-tracker

### Overview:
For this assignment, I created a workout tracker that allows users to be able to view, create and track daily workouts . With existing front end code, this project required creation of a Mongo database with a Mongoose schema and handle routes with Express.

The user should be able to:

  * Add exercises to the most recent workout plan.

  * Add new exercises to a new workout plan.

  * View the combined weight of multiple exercises from the past seven workouts on the `stats` page.

  * View the total duration of each workout from the past seven workouts on the `stats` page.
